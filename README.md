# What is this project?
    This app accesses news about a particular topic and sends them by email.
If you want to try the main app, first you should configure propperly the send_email script
with your email and password** from where you will send the email (is this ocasion it is 
configured with my information) and add the adrees of destination of that email.

** the password has to be one uniq password for external aplication usage. Check with your email provider
how to get that kind of password (if you use gmail account you can get one from the account manager). 
It has to be one different password; not your personal password.
